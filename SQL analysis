1) Find the average GDP value for the Benelux countries between 1990 - 2000.

WITH 
bel AS (
SELECT country,year,gdp FROM economy WHERE country='Belgium'
),
net AS (
SELECT country,year,gdp FROM economy WHERE country='Netherlands'
),
lux AS (
SELECT country,year,gdp FROM economy WHERE country='Luxembourg'
)
SELECT AVG(gdp) AS avg_gdp, 'Belgium' AS country  FROM bel WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
UNION
SELECT AVG(gdp) AS avg_gdp, 'Netherlands' AS country  FROM net WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
UNION
SELECT AVG(gdp) AS avg_gdp, 'Luxembourg' AS country  FROM lux WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Find the maximum GDP values along with its corresponding years for the Benelux countries between 1990 - 2000.


WITH 
bel AS (
SELECT TOP (1) row = ROW_Number() OVER (ORDER BY gdp DESC), 
country,year,gdp FROM economy WHERE country='Belgium' AND year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000

3) Find export, annual export percentage and total annual export
for the three largest countries in South America between 2015 - 2017. 


SELECT country, year, exports_gs,
100*ROUND(CAST(exports_gs AS REAL)/SUM(CAST(exports_gs AS REAL)) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY year),2)  
AS export_percentage,
SUM(exports_gs) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY year) 
AS total_export
FROM economy WHERE country IN('Brazil','Argentina','Peru')
AND year BETWEEN 2015 AND 2017 ORDER BY year, country;

4) Characterize the Gross fixed capital formation of Spain, four years before 
and four years after the 2008 financial crisis using the cumulative sum.

SELECT country, year, gross_fixed,
SUM(gross_fixed) OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY year) 
AS cumulative_sum, 
CASE

		THEN 'pre-crisis'
	WHEN year = 2007
		THEN 'Total  pre-crisis cumulative sum'
END
AS description
FROM PreCrisis WHERE country IN('Spain')
UNION
